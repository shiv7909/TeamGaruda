# 👁️ Third Eye — A Smart Civic Issue Reporting App  
*By Team Garuda*

---

## 🚀 Overview

**Third Eye** is a smart and simple mobile solution that enables citizens to report, view, and track civic issues within their neighborhood — whether it's a pothole, water leakage, or broken streetlight. The app ensures your voice is heard, with full transparency and real-time status updates.

> Many citizens don’t know **where** to report issues or **what happens afterward**. Third Eye addresses this by making it easy to report, filter, and **track issue timelines** within a 5 km radius of your location.
